1. ### In the terminal or development environment, enter the command:

- Go to the section **OAuth2** in the item **URL Generator**
- In the **Scopes** field, select **bot**, and in the **Bot Permissions** field that appears, BE sure to set the permissions **Read Messages/View Channels** and **Send Messages**, the rest of the permissions are at your discretion
- By the generated link, we invite the bot to the server

#### This code was developed solely as a funny joke, do not forget that everyone's humor is different and if it's funny to you, then it may seem offensive to another. Do not forget about the existence of the `!sspam` command, do not force your friends to leave the server or ban you. If the bot was used against you, then you can block it in the user settings. The author does not take responsibility for all actions that will be done by third parties using my open source code!
