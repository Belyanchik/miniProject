<h3 align="center">I found my old gaming steering wheel and decided to use it to drive cars in Fortnite. The game does not support controllers of this kind and I solved this issue in my own way ðŸ™ƒ</h3>
<p>The code was developed for the <b>Dialog GW 301 controller</b>. I can't guarantee that the code will run without errors for other game controllers. The program was developed mainly for Fortnite, but the main functionality can be used in other games.</p>

<p>The code works directly in the terminal</p>
