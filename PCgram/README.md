1. ### In a terminal or development environment, enter the commands:

- `pip install pyTelegramBotAPI`

- `pip install Pillow`

- `pip install pyscreenshot`

And we are waiting for the packages to be installed

2. ### We create bot for Telegram (If you know how to do it, you can move on to the next step)

- We enter into a dialogue with the bot `@BotFather`
- If you have never created your Telegram bots, then use the command `/start`
- We use the command `/newbot` and respond to messages

3. ### Code preparation

- Open file `config.py`
- Open a dialog with `@BotFather` and find the message that was sent to you immediately after the bot was created.Take the token and paste it into the dictionary value with the key `TOKEN`
- Fill the `WHITE_LIST' dictionary with allowed IDs. If you don't know your id, launch the bot right like this and enter the command `/id`. Add the result to the list
- Fill the dictionary with `processes` the processes you need to display, according to the template
